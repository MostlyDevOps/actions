  # this job runs after a push/merge to the default branch
  # it will create a PR on a *different* repo that has
  # Kustomize YAML, and will update the image tags to the new one
  # This is an example of a "promotion" workflow where once a new image
  # is created from the default_branch of an app, that a Kubernetes
  # environment YAML needs to be updated as well.
  # This will save humans the steps of looking up the new image tag
  # and creating a new PR to update the Kustomize YAML.
  # You could also change this to update a Helm chart values file.
